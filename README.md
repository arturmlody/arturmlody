Hey, my name is Artur and I started this repo to store my work and look through my progress
I'm interested mainly in C# since I studied it in uni and it fit me well so it's gonna be my main language in here
My current goal is to learn ASP.NET Core and work on connecting with SQL 
There will be some older projects of mine stored in here from my University time which aren't anything special, but they show how I progressed through time
